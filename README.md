Impulse is a small library for use with
[application.garden](https://application.garden). It provides an
extremely opinionated framework for rapidly prototyping web
applications using [htmx](https://htmx.org), [Pico
CSS](https://picocss.com),
[reitit](https://github.com/metosin/reitit), and
[hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup). The goal is going
from nothing to something as quickly and effortlessly as possible,
thus making it easier to follow an impulse to build something new.

Garden tries to improve the experience of building and deploying
Internet-facing computer programs. In the context of web applications,
this includes providing low-ceremony support for many normally tedious
things: [user
accounts/login](https://github.com/nextjournal/garden-id) (with
support for common OAuth back ends),
[email](https://github.com/nextjournal/garden-email) (sending and
receiving), and a pure Clojure [cron-like
system](https://github.com/nextjournal/garden-cron) for scheduling
background tasks. Impulse layers on top of these features to provide
an approach to rapid prototyping with Garden.
